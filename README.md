<h2>About this Project</h2>
<p>This was a project that helped me implement my learned skills with Web Dev technologies into a site I would use every day.
I had seen APIs and heard about them, and this was my first project where I registered and utilized API calls.</p>

<p>One thing I learned during this project was how to accept a return from APIs and how to present the information onto a web page. 
I also learned how to create error cases to prevent errors from ruining functionality.</p>
